# two different techniques in dynamic programming

## Memoization 
Its where we add caching to a function (that has no side effects). In dynamic programming, it is typically used on recursive functions for a top-down solution that starts with the initial problem and then recursively calls itself to solve smaller problems.
## Tabulation 
It uses a table to keep track of subproblem results and works in a bottom-up manner: solving the smallest subproblems before the large ones, in an iterative manner. Often, people use the words "tabulation" and "dynamic programming" interchangeably.
